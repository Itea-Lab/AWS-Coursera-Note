# **AWS Infrastructure, Access, and Security Fundamentals**

## **1. Introduction**

- **Context:** Building an employee directory application that requires the storage of photos and ensuring high availability, redundancy, and security.
- **Purpose:** Understand how AWS data centers, Availability Zones (AZs), and Regions enable global, redundant storage, and explore ways to interact with AWS and secure applications using the shared responsibility model and Identity and Access Management (IAM).

---

## **2. Data Storage and Redundancy**

### **2.1 Why Store Data in AWS?**
- Storing employee photos in AWS means:
  - **Reliability:** Safe from local hardware failures (e.g., your laptop breaking).
  - **Accessibility:** Available from *anywhere* (home, phone, plane).
  - **Redundancy:** AWS keeps multiple copies to mitigate data center outages.

### **2.2 Redundancy Within a Data Center**
- AWS stores data on servers inside data centers.
- **Risk Example:** A data center destroyed by a natural disaster (or even an alien invasion).
- **Solution:** AWS uses redundancy—multiple data centers networked together with high-speed, low-latency links.

### **2.3 Availability Zones (AZs)**
- **Definition:** A cluster of one or more data centers with independent power, networking, and connectivity.
- Each AZ is designed to remain operational if another AZ in the same region fails.

### **2.4 Regions**
- **Definition:** A cluster of AZs in a specific geographic area.
- Each AWS **Region** contains multiple AZs, interconnected but physically separate.
- **Naming Convention:** Typically named for geographic location (e.g., *Northern Virginia*, *Oregon*, *London*).

### **2.5 Choosing an AWS Region**
Consider four factors:
1. **Compliance:** Legal or regulatory requirements (e.g., data must remain in the UK).
2. **Latency:** Proximity to users (lower latency when hosted closer).
3. **Pricing:** Costs differ by region (e.g., tax structures may make some regions more expensive).
4. **Service Availability:** Some new services are launched in only a few regions initially.

> **Key Takeaway:** Data centers nest inside AZs, and AZs nest inside Regions. Region choice is driven by *compliance*, *latency*, *price*, and *service availability*.

## **3. Global Edge Network**

### **3.1 Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches**
- **Edge Locations:** Used to cache content closer to end users, reducing latency.
- **Regional Edge Caches:** Larger caches that sit between AWS services and Edge Locations.
- **Example Use Case:** Hosting a globally accessed website from Ohio. Users in Asia or Europe experience higher latency unless content is cached at their nearest Edge Location.

### **3.2 Caching Services**
- **Amazon CloudFront:** Main AWS service leveraging Edge Locations to cache (and distribute) content around the globe.

> **Key Takeaway:** The **Global Edge Network** helps reduce latency for users far from the primary Region by **caching** frequently accessed content.

## **4. Ways to Interact with AWS**

AWS offers three main methods to create, configure, and manage resources:

1. **AWS Management Console**
   - Web-based, GUI-driven interface.
   - Ideal for beginners or one-off manual tasks (point-and-click approach).
   - Potential for human error when repeatedly configuring complex resources.

2. **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)**
   - Access and manage AWS services via defined commands in a terminal or AWS CloudShell.
   - Enables **scripting** and **automation**—reduces manual mistakes and speeds repeatability.
   - Requires learning specific **syntax** for commands.

3. **AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)**
   - Programmatic interaction via popular programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js).
   - Lets you integrate AWS calls directly within application code (e.g., uploading images to S3).
   - Powerful for building custom, automated workflows with loops, conditions, and data structures.

> **Key Takeaway:** Choose the **Console** for simple or initial tasks, the **CLI** for automation and scripting, and **SDKs** when integrating AWS services directly in application code.

## **5. AWS Shared Responsibility Model**

### **5.1 Overview**
- **Security *of* the Cloud:** AWS secures underlying infrastructure (physical data centers, network, hardware, virtualization layer).
- **Security *in* the Cloud:** *You* secure everything you deploy *on top* of AWS services (operating systems, application data, configurations, access management).

### **5.2 Building Analogy**
- Think of AWS like a construction company responsible for the *building* (foundation, walls, etc.).
- You rent an apartment (your AWS resources) and must lock your *door* (configure your security settings, patch OS, control traffic, encrypt data).

### **5.3 Service-Specific Responsibility**
- Responsibilities vary per service:
  - For Amazon EC2: AWS secures physical hosts and hypervisor, you patch and secure guest OS.
  - For Amazon S3: AWS secures underlying storage, you control encryption, permissions, access.

> **Key Takeaway:** Both **AWS** and the **customer** share security tasks. The exact division depends on the service.

## **6. Root User and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

### **6.1 The Root User**
- Created upon opening an AWS account (your account email + password).
- Has **unrestricted, all-powerful access**—avoid using it for daily tasks.

### **6.2 The Importance of MFA**
- **Single-factor authentication** = only a password, vulnerable to guessing or theft.
- **MFA** adds an extra layer (e.g., one-time code from phone) to deter unauthorized access.
- **Best Practice:** 
  - Immediately enable MFA on root user.
  - Use strong passwords, store them securely.
  - Then create an **admin IAM user** for everyday tasks. 

> **Key Takeaway:** **Enable MFA** and **minimize** root user usage to secure your AWS account from breaches.

## **7. Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

### **7.1 Access Control Overview**
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is used for:
  - **Account-Level Users** (operators, admins, developers).
  - **Programmatic Access** (apps or services calling other AWS services).

### **7.2 IAM for Your AWS Account**
- **IAM User:** Represents an individual needing console or programmatic access. Each user gets unique credentials.
- **IAM Group:** A collection of IAM users; attaching an IAM policy to a group grants those permissions to all members.
- **IAM Policy:** A JSON document defining:
  - **Effect** (Allow/Deny)
  - **Action** (e.g., `ec2:RunInstances`, `s3:*`)
  - **Resource** (the specific AWS resource(s) allowed/denied)
  - **Condition** (optional restrictions, e.g., IP range)

### **7.3 Best Practices**
1. **Use IAM Users** rather than root for daily tasks.
2. **Enable MFA** for root user and any privileged users.
3. **Attach Policies to Groups**, then assign users to groups for simpler administration.
4. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the permissions needed.

## **8. IAM Roles**

### **8.1 Definition**
- A **temporary** set of permissions that an entity (service, user, or external identity) can assume.
- *No* username or password; instead uses **temporary security credentials** (rotated automatically).

### **8.2 Common Use Cases**
1. **AWS Service to AWS Service**  
   - Example: An EC2 instance’s application code accesses S3. The instance *assumes* a role that grants S3 permissions.
2. **Federated Access**  
   - External corporate identity providers or single sign-on (SSO) solutions assume an IAM role for AWS access, avoiding separate IAM users for each employee.

### **8.3 Role Example (EC2 to S3)**
- Create an IAM Role with a policy granting S3 (and possibly DynamoDB) access.
- Assign role to the EC2 instance.
- The instance automatically fetches temporary credentials from the role to make signed API requests to S3.

> **Key Takeaway:** **IAM Roles** enable secure, temporary access without static credentials, ideal for applications calling AWS services or for cross-account and federated access.

## **9. Putting It All Together: Employee Directory Application**

1. **Application-Level Access:**  
   - Usernames/passwords *inside* the app, separate from IAM.
2. **EC2 to S3 Access:**  
   - Achieved via **IAM Role** with permissions for S3 (storing employee photos).
3. **Admin/Developer Access to AWS:**  
   - Handled with **IAM Users** (unique credentials, policy-based permissions).
4. **Root User Usage:**  
   - *Only* for essential tasks (like account setup, billing changes). MFA **must** be enabled.
