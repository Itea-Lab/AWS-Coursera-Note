## Lecture Notes: AWS Compute Services (EC2, Lambda, Containers, Fargate)

### I. Introduction to AWS Compute and EC2

**Key Concept:**  AWS provides various compute services, each designed for different use cases.  A core service is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

*   **Compute as a Service:**  AWS handles infrastructure (data centers, servers, networking), allowing users to focus on applications.  This contrasts with on-premises, where you manage everything (research, purchase, racking, wiring, security, etc.).
*   **Value of EC2:**
    *   **On-Demand Provisioning:** Create and terminate EC2 instances (virtual machines) as needed.
    *   **Elasticity:** Scale your fleet of EC2 instances up or down based on demand.
    *   **Pay-Per-Use:** Charged only for running instances (typically per second or per hour).
    *   **Flexibility:** Stop and start instances at will.

**Key Takeaway:** EC2 offers a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to run virtual machines in the cloud, eliminating the overhead of managing physical hardware.

### II. EC2 Instance Lifecycle

**Key Concept:** An EC2 instance transitions through several states from launch to termination.  Understanding these states is crucial for managing instances and controlling costs.

*   **States:**
    1.  **Pending:**  The instance is booting up (like a VM starting).  Launched from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
    2.  **Running:** Instance is operational and ready for use.  *You are charged while in this state*.
    3.  **Stopping:**  Transition state before entering the *Stopped* state.
    4.  **Stopped:**  Like powering down a laptop.  Can be restarted, going through *Pending* and back to *Running*.
    5.  **Stop-Hibernate:** Similar to *Stopped*, but the instance's state is saved to memory (like closing a laptop lid).  Faster restart than *Stopped*.  *Charged while in the stopping phase when hibernating*
    6.  **Shutting Down:** Transition state before entering the *Terminated* state.
    7.  **Terminated:** Instance is permanently deleted (like throwing a laptop in the ocean!).  *Data is lost unless backed up*.

*   **Instance Actions:**
    *   **Reboot:**  Restarts the instance (like rebooting a laptop).
    *   **Stop:**  Powers down the instance.
    *   **Stop-Hibernate:** Saves instance state to memory for fast restart.
    *   **Terminate:** Permanently deletes the instance.

*  **Termination Protection:** Feature to prevent accidental termination.

*   **Persistent Storage:** EC2 offers options for persistent storage (covered in future lessons) to ensure data survives instance termination.

* **Instance Lifecycle Management is Key**
    *   Updating Instances: It is valid to terminate an instance with an old patch, and deploy a new one, instead of patching in place.
    *   Scaling: Launching instances on increased demand, terminating on decreased demand, is considered good practice.

**Key Takeaway:** Understanding the EC2 instance lifecycle allows you to manage instances effectively, optimize costs, and implement strategies like replacing outdated instances with new ones instead of patching in place.

### III. EC2 Configurations

**Key Concept:** EC2 instances offer extensive configuration options, allowing you to tailor them to specific application needs.

*   **Operating System (OS):** Choose from various OS options (Linux, Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, etc.) using **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**.
*   **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):**
    *   Template for instance configuration.
    *   Defines OS, pre-installed applications, and other settings.
    *   Sources: AWS-provided, community (AWS Marketplace), or custom-built.
    *   *Example:* Amazon Linux 2 (EC2-optimized, long-term support).
*   **Instance Type and Size:**
    *   Determines hardware resources (CPU, memory, network, GPU).
    *   Grouped by use case (e.g., compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, GPU-optimized).
    *   *Example:*  `G` family (graphics-intensive), `M5` (general-purpose).
    *   Naming convention: `Instance Type`.`Size` (e.g., `T3.small`, `A1.medium`).
    *   **Right-Sizing:** Choose an instance type and size appropriate for the application's needs (avoid over-provisioning).
* **Resizability:** EC2 allows changing instance types easily, adapting to evolving needs.  This is much harder with on-premises hardware.
*   **API-Driven Configuration:** All configurations can be managed via API calls, enabling automation.

**Key Takeaway:** EC2's configurability allows for precise resource allocation, optimization, and adaptation to changing application requirements, fostering innovation and cost efficiency.

### IV. Choosing the Right AWS Compute Service: Game Show!

**Objective:** Determine the appropriate AWS compute service for different use cases.

*   **Use Case 1: Automating Inventory Updates**
    *   **Scenario:**  Automate loading new inventory data from spreadsheets (uploaded to Amazon S3) into a database.  New inventory is added quarterly.
    *   **Possible Solutions:**
        *   **EC2:** *Could* work, but inefficient (instance running constantly for a task that runs quarterly).  Costly and requires manual start/stop automation.
        *   **AWS Lambda:** *Best Fit*.  Event-driven, only runs when triggered (S3 upload).  Cost-effective (pay only for execution time).
    *   **Solution:** AWS Lambda
        *   Create a Lambda function triggered by an S3 `PutEvent`.
        *   Function code parses the spreadsheet and updates the database.

*   **Use Case 2: Migrating an On-Premises Application**
    *   **Scenario:** Migrate a Linux-based application from an on-premises data center to AWS. Minimize refactoring.  Workload needs to be elastic.
    *   **Solution:** Amazon EC2
        *   Launch EC2 instances from Linux-based AMIs.
        *   Application can be hosted similarly to on-premises.
        *   EC2 supports scaling (elasticity).
        *   *Reasoning:*  Lambda and container services (ECS, EKS) would require significant refactoring.

*   **Use Case 3: Building a New Microservices Application**
    *   **Scenario:** Build a new application using a microservices architecture.  Needs to scale quickly and minimize deployment risk.
    *   **Solution:** Container Services (Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS)
        *   Containers are well-suited for microservices.
        *   Containers boot quickly, enabling rapid scaling.
        *   Containers improve code portability, reducing deployment risks.

**Key Takeaway:** Different AWS compute services are designed for specific use cases.  Choosing the right service depends on factors like application architecture, scaling needs, cost optimization, and operational overhead.  Don't default to EC2; consider alternatives.

### V. Container Services (ECS, EKS)

**Key Concept:** Containers provide efficiency and portability for applications. AWS offers container orchestration services.

*   **Containers:**
    *   Package application code, dependencies, and configuration into a single executable.
    *   **Portability:** Consistent behavior across different environments (dev, QA, production).  *Example:* Docker containers.
*   **Container Orchestration:**
    *   Manages starting, stopping, restarting, and monitoring containers across a cluster (multiple EC2 instances).
    *   Essential for scaling containerized applications.
*   **AWS Container Services:**
    *   **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS):** AWS's container orchestration service.
    *   **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):** Uses Kubernetes for container orchestration.
*   **Interaction:** Manage containers through the orchestration tool's API.
*   **Scaling:** Automate scaling of both the cluster and the containers.
*   **Fast Boot-Up:** Containers boot faster than VMs, enabling rapid response to demand.

**Key Takeaway:** Container services (ECS, EKS) provide a platform for running and managing containerized applications at scale, offering benefits like portability, rapid scaling, and simplified management.

### VI. Serverless Compute (AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate)

**Key Concept:** Serverless computing abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, simplifying operations and reducing management overhead.

*   **Serverless Definition:**  You cannot see or access the underlying infrastructure (servers).  AWS manages provisioning, scaling, fault tolerance, and maintenance.
*   **Focus on Application:**  Developers focus on the application logic, not infrastructure management.
*   **Reduced Operational Overhead:** Fewer operational support processes.
*   **Shared Responsibility Model Shift:** AWS takes on more responsibility (e.g., OS patching).
*   **Convenience vs. Control Spectrum:**  AWS services offer a range of options, from high control (EC2) to high convenience (serverless).
*   **AWS Lambda:**
    *   Run code in response to triggers (events).
    *   No need to manage servers.
    *   Scales automatically.
    *   Pay-per-use (only for execution time).
    *   Suitable for short-running processes (under 15 minutes).
    *   *Example:* Image resizing triggered by S3 uploads (demo).
    * **Lambda Demo Steps:**
        1. Create function (choose runtime, permissions â€“ IAM Role).
        2. Add trigger (S3 `PutEvent` for this example).
        3. Upload code (zip file).
        4. Test by uploading an image to S3.
* **AWS Fargate:**
    *   Serverless compute platform for containers (ECS and EKS).
    *   No need to manage underlying EC2 instances.
    *   Define application content, networking, storage, and scaling requirements.
    *   Pay only for consumed vCPU, memory, and storage.
    *   Supports spot and compute savings plan pricing.
    * **Fargate workflow**
        1.  Build and push container images to a repository (e.g., Amazon ECR)
        2.  Define resources (memory, vCPU) per task (ECS) or pod (EKS)
        3.  Run your containers.
    *   **Use Cases:** Microservices, batch processing, machine learning, application migration.

**Key Takeaway:** Serverless computing (Lambda, Fargate) simplifies operations, reduces management overhead, and allows developers to focus on application logic. It offers automatic scaling, fault tolerance, and pay-per-use pricing, making it a compelling option for many use cases.

### VII: Launching the Employee Directory Application on EC2.
* Log into the AWS Console and go to the EC2 Dashboard.
* **Launch Instance:**
    * Name: `employee directory app`
    * AMI: `Amazon Linux 2023 AMI`.
    * Instance Type: `t2.micro` (free-tier eligible).
    * Key Pair: *Proceed without a key pair*.
    * Network Settings:
        * Default VPC.
        * Auto-assign Public IP: *Enable*.
    * Security Group:
        *  *Disable* SSH.
        * *Allow* HTTPS.
        * *Allow* HTTP.
    * Storage: Leave default root volume.
    * Advanced Details:
        * IAM Instance Profile: `employee web app role` (grants permissions to access S3 and DynamoDB).
        * User Data (Bash Script):
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            wget <S3_ZIP_FILE_URL>  # Download application zip from S3
            unzip <ZIP_FILE_NAME>
            cd <UNZIPPED_DIRECTORY>
            yum install -y python3 python3-pip
            pip3 install -r requirements.txt
            yum install -y stress
            export PHOTOS_BUCKET=<PLACEHOLDER>  # S3 bucket for photos (will be configured later)
            export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2  # Example region
            export DYNAMO_MODE=on
            python3 app.py  # Run the Flask application
            ```
* **Instance Launch and Verification:**
    * Wait for instance state to be `Running` and status checks to pass.
    * Access the application using the public IP address in a browser.

**Key Takeaway:** This section shows a complete example of taking advantage of EC2, the EC2 instance lifecycle, and best practices.
