## **Module 1 Lecture Notes: AWS Cloud Migration**
---

### **1. Introduction to Migration**
- **Definition of Migration (in Tech Context)**  
  In technology, *migration* refers to *moving an application stack or workloads from one platform to another*, such as moving from on-premises infrastructure to the AWS Cloud.

- **Analogy (Bird Migration)**  
  While the dictionary defines *migration* as the movement of birds or animals, the principle in IT is similar: *moving your technology stack* to a different “location” or platform.

- **Historical Context**  
  - Mainframes → Servers  
  - Servers → Virtual Machines (VMs)  
  - VMs → Cloud  
  Organizations regularly embrace new technologies to improve efficiency, reduce costs, or innovate more quickly.

### **2. Why Migrate?**
1. **Cost Savings**  
   - Moving to the AWS Cloud can *reduce infrastructure costs* by an average of **31%**.  
   - Organizations avoid costly data-center leases, hardware upgrades, and maintenance.

2. **Mandates or Organizational Changes**  
   - Mergers, acquisitions, or new leadership (e.g., a new CTO) can *drive* a move to the cloud.  
   - Expiring data-center leases often push companies to avoid renewal and migrate instead.

3. **Elasticity & Scalability**  
   - Scale resources up/down in response to demand.  
   - Provision servers quickly without the overhead of physical hardware purchases.

4. **Reliability & High Availability**  
   - Rapidly replace failed components in the cloud.  
   - Automated scaling and redundancy help ensure uptime.

5. **Security**  
   - AWS’s *Shared Responsibility Model*:
     - AWS handles *security of the cloud* (e.g., data-center physical security).  
     - Customers handle *security in the cloud* (e.g., user access, data encryption).  
   - Includes extensive *native* security services: encryption, DDoS protection, secret management, edge security, etc.

6. **Flexibility & Speed of Deployment**  
   - Rapid provisioning of new environments.  
   - Codified infrastructure (Infrastructure as Code) enables quick testing and rollbacks.  
   - Constant influx of new AWS services to address evolving needs.

### **3. Migration Strategies: The “7 Rs”**
1. **Relocate**  
   - Move compatible applications (e.g., Docker or VMware) without major code changes.
2. **Rehost** (Lift and Shift)  
   - Move existing applications with minimal modifications.  
   - Easiest if dependencies are straightforward but still requires planning.
3. **Replatform**  
   - Make some optimizations without changing core application architecture.  
   - Example: Migrating a database from on-prem to Amazon RDS with minor tweaks.
4. **Repurchase**  
   - Switch from a self-managed application to a SaaS (Software as a Service) option.  
   - Example: Moving from a custom CRM to an AWS Marketplace solution.
5. **Refactor**  
   - Substantial code and architectural changes for cloud-native benefits.  
   - Example: Breaking down a monolithic app into microservices with AWS Lambda.
6. **Retire**  
   - Decommission applications or services no longer needed post-migration.
7. **Retain**  
   - Keep certain apps on-prem if they are not ready or beneficial to move.

> **Key Takeaway:** Not all workloads require the same migration strategy. *Some applications might be rehosted quickly, while others need a deeper refactor.*

### **4. Approaches to Migration**
1. **Lift and Shift (Rehosting)**  
   - Move applications to AWS as-is, usually involving minimal code changes.  
   - *Pros*: Faster migration, straightforward.  
   - *Cons*: May not fully leverage cloud-native features; can still have legacy issues.

2. **Hybrid Deployment**  
   - Run some parts on-prem and others in the cloud.  
   - *Pros*: Easier incremental migration, addressing complex dependencies step by step.  
   - *Cons*: More complex networking and coordination between environments.

3. **Refactoring or Rearchitecting**  
   - Higher effort but enables modern, cloud-native architectures (e.g., serverless).  
   - *Pros*: Potential for major gains in cost efficiency, performance, scalability.  
   - *Cons*: Requires a skilled team, more time, possible code rewrites.

### **5. AWS Migration Phases**
AWS structures migration into a **three-phase iterative** model:

1. **Assess**  
   - *Evaluate* readiness for the cloud: identify business objectives, current environment, *why* you’re migrating.  
   - Use AWS tools to gather data (e.g., *AWS Application Discovery Service*) to build a cost projection and total cost of ownership (TCO).

2. **Mobilize**  
   - *Create the migration plan* and refine the business case.  
   - Address any gaps uncovered during *Assess*.  
   - Build or improve the *landing zone* (your baseline AWS environment).  
   - Identify interdependencies between applications and confirm which migration strategies to apply.

3. **Migrate and Modernize**  
   - *Execute* the actual migration based on your plan.  
   - Validate the newly deployed environment, modernize further if needed (e.g., refactoring to serverless, leveraging container services).  
   - Use specialized AWS tools (e.g., *AWS Database Migration Service*, *AWS DataSync*, *AWS Snow Family*).

> **Iterative Nature**: Each time you move additional workloads, you learn from prior migrations, speeding up subsequent rounds.

### **6. Planning & Team Collaboration**
- **Importance of a Detailed Plan**  
  - Define *what moves first*, what services map to AWS, and projected timelines.  
  - Avoid “scope creep” by establishing clear milestones.
  - Example: Alex’s anecdote with a startup highlights how a *lack of roadmap* led to extended timelines.

- **Team Buy-In**  
  - Consult *DBAs*, *front-end teams*, *DevOps*, etc.  
  - Each role brings unique insights (e.g., DBAs help with database considerations).  
  - Proper communication ensures everyone is *rowing in the same direction*.

- **Training & Skill Building**  
  - *AWS Training* for all roles speeds up adoption and reduces errors.  
  - Tools and platforms (AWS services, serverless, containers) may be new to some staff.

### **8. Examples & Illustrations**
- **Lift and Shift Example**:  
  - On-prem Virtual Machines → **Amazon EC2**.
  - Minimal code changes but ensures a swift migration.

- **Hybrid Example**:  
  - Keep your *Active Directory server* and part of your *database* on-prem.  
  - Move frontend web servers to AWS for scalability.  
  - Network connectivity must be carefully managed (VPN or Direct Connect).

- **Refactoring Example**:  
  - COBOL or older code → rewrite into *cloud-native* services on AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB).  
  - Requires a thorough architectural rework but yields modern capabilities.

### **9. Key Takeaways / Summary**
1. **Migration Is Inevitable**: Tech stacks evolve; being *cloud-ready* keeps you competitive.  
2. **Plan Thoroughly**: Map every dependency, *choose the right strategy*, and *schedule realistically* (avoid guesswork).  
3. **Use a Phased Approach**: *Assess*, *Mobilize*, then *Migrate & Modernize*. Iterate and refine.  
4. **Communicate with Stakeholders**: Ensure *all teams* understand the roadmap and responsibilities.  
5. **Leverage AWS Tools**: AWS provides *robust migration services* (Migration Hub, Application Migration Service, DMS, DataSync, etc.).  
6. **Don’t Forget Training**: Upskilling is crucial—familiarize everyone with AWS best practices.

### **10. Possible Gaps or Ambiguities**
- **Specific Application Details**: In the script, Walter withholds details about actual workloads. *Real-world planning* requires specifics (e.g., OS, DB engines, latency requirements).  
- **Exact Timelines**: Each workload migration differs—AWS tools can *estimate*, but real timelines depend on complexity.  
- **Security Requirements**: Script gives a general overview. *Regulatory compliance* or advanced encryption needs more in-depth analysis.
